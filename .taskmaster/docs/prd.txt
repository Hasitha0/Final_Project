# EcoTech E-Waste Management Platform - Product Requirements Document

## Project Overview
EcoTech is a comprehensive e-waste management platform that connects the general public with waste collectors and recycling centers to facilitate responsible electronic waste disposal. The system uses React + JavaScript (JSX) + Tailwind CSS v3.4.17 with a planned Supabase backend integration.

**Development Approach**: Complete all frontend development first with mock data, then integrate with Supabase.

## Technology Stack
- Frontend: React + JavaScript (JSX)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS v3.4.17
- Backend (Future): Supabase
- Development Phase: Frontend-first with mock data

## User Types and Authentication System

### 1. General Public (Primary Users)
- **Role**: E-waste generators who need collection services
- **Registration**: Direct registration via Register button
- **Dashboard**: Public user dashboard with request management

### 2. Waste Collectors (Service Providers)
- **Role**: Field operatives who collect e-waste
- **Registration**: Via Career page, requires admin approval
- **Dashboard**: Collector dashboard with task management

### 3. Recycling Center Staff (Processing Units)
- **Role**: Facility operators who process e-waste
- **Registration**: Via dedicated form, requires admin approval
- **Dashboard**: Center-specific dashboard

### 4. Admin (System Operators)
- **Role**: System administrators with full oversight
- **Dashboard**: Complete system management interface
